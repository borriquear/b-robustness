\section{Introduction}
%Relevance of RS 

%Network theory approaches to brain connectivity in resting state-
%fMRI have been mainly focused on the study of topological properties and
%network motifs that characterize the network structure. The network
%degeneration hypothesis -disease starts in small network assemblies, to
%progressively spread to connected areas of the initial locus- has been
%investigated in a number of brain pathologies. For example, the
%disruption of normal brain function in diseases such as schizophrenia and
%Alzheimer's disease can be observed and measured in terms of variations in the
%network topology.  
%However, a coherent and integrative understanding of the
%interplay between brain disease and network connectivity is still missing. 

It has been suggested that fluctuations in the BOLD signal measured
in humans in resting state, represent the neuronal activity baseline and shape
spatially consistent patterns \cite{Raichle:2005}, \cite{Fransson:2006}. These
slow fluctuations in the BOLD signal found in resting subjects, are highly
coherent within either structural or functional networks in the human brain. Therefore,
exploring these fluctuations could lead to a better understanding of the
brain's intrinsic or spontaneous neural activity.
Functional correlation based on the synchrony of low-frequency blood flow
fluctuations in resting state, have been identified in the sensorimotor
\cite{kokkonen_preoperative_2009}, visual \cite{damoiseaux_consistent_2006},
language \cite{hampson_detection_2002}, auditory
\cite{hunter_neural_2006}, dorsal and ventral attention
\cite{fox_spontaneous_2006} and the frontoparietal control system
\cite{vincent_evidence_2008}.
The systematic study of those patterns using correlation
analysis techniques has identified a number of resting state networks, which
are functionally relevant networks found in subjects in the absence of either
goal directed-task or external stimuli.

%Seed based versus ICA 
The visual identification of the
overall connectivity patters in resting state functional magnetic resonance
imaging (R-fMRI), has been assessed using either model-based and model-free
approaches. In the former, statistical parametric maps of brain activation are
built upon voxel-wise analysis location. %references HERE
This approach has been successful in
the identification of motor networks, but it shows important limitations when
the seed voxel cannot be easily identified. For example, in brain areas with
unclear boundaries i.e., cognitive networks involved for instance, in language
or memory. Independent Component Analysis (ICA), on the other hand, is a
model-free approach that allows separating resting fluctuations from other
signal variations, resulting on a collection of spatial maps, one for each
independent component, that represent functionally relevant networks in the
brain. While ICA has the advantage over model-free methods that it is unbiased,
(that is, it does not need to posit a specific temporal model of correlation
between ROIs), the functional relevance of the different components is,
however, computed relative to their resemblance to a number of networks based
on criteria that are not easily formalized.
%GT 

More recently, researchers using graph-theory based methods have been able to
not only visualize brain networks, but to quantify their topological properties. Large-scale anatomical
connectivity analysis in the mammalian brain, shows that brain topology is
neither random nor regular. Instead, small world
architectures \cite{Watts:1998} -highly clustered nodes connected thorough
relatively short paths- have been identified in brain networks. 
%\cite{Vaessen:2010}.
Small world networks are not solely
structural, functional networks with a small world organization have been
identified in the mammal brain \cite{Bassett:2006}. In addition to
this, disruptions in the small world organization can give clues about normal
development and pathological conditions. For example, Supekar and colleagues
\cite{Supekar:2008} have shown that the deterioration of small world
properties such as the lowering of the cluster coefficient, affect local
network connectivity, which in turn may work as a network biomarker for
Alzheimer's disease. Abnormalities in small-worldness may also have a
significant positive correlation in, for example, schizophrenia
\cite{liu_disrupted_2008} and epilepsy \cite{liao_altered_2010}. While
network-based studies have been successful in delineating generic network properties, such as
path length or clustering, additional work is needed in order to come to grips
with the internal working of the systems underlying the network. 

Robustness in
brain connectivity has been typically approached in terms of the impact that
the complete disruption and/or removal of a network component has in the
network topology \cite{Kaiser:2007}. However, by focusing on the topology
of the network, factors that may play a key role in the network's vulnerability to
failures can be neglected. For example, it has been suggested that patients
with Alzheimer's disease show an increment in brain activity in certain areas
relative to healthy subjects that compensates for the disease related atrophy
of other regions \cite{Sanz-Arigita:2010}. 
%NDH states that neurological diseases target
%functional neural networks modifying its topological properties, 
The network degeneration hypothesis, NDH for short, encompasses the idea that
neurodegeneration can be studied as a network dysfunction process, in which
changes in the network organization are informative about the progression of
the disease \cite{Seeley:2009}, \cite{Mesulam:2009}. %This paves the way for a
%network-based approach to diagnosis of
%neural disorders, and the discovery of network biomarkers in early disease
%detection. 
The network
degeneration hypothesis -disease starts in small network assemblies, to
progressively spread to connected areas of the initial locus- has been
investigated in a number of brain pathologies including Alzheimer's disease \cite{Buckner:2009}, epilepsy
\cite{liao_altered_2010}, schizophrenia \cite{liu_disrupted_2008} and unipolar
depression \cite{lord_changes_2012}.
To our knowledge, the first attempt to systematically test the NDH is in
\cite{Seeley:2009}, in which Seeley and colleagues use functional and structural network mapping 
approaches to characterize five distinct neurodegenerative syndromes. 
%http://www.alzforum.org/new/detail.asp?id=2106

In this paper we explore the network
degeneration hypothesis using a
methodology that combines graph and information theoretic tools. 
In section \ref{mat-methods} the methodology followed in the data acquisition,
data preprocessing, anatomical parcellation and brain network reconstruction
in two groups -24 young and 19 elder individuals- is presented. 
Then we systematically study network
robustness -functional network invariance under perturbation- is affected upon
the removal of nodes in the functional connectivity network in resting state
for both young and elder subjects. We provide a ranking of nodes that quantifies the impact of their obliteration
using a network efficiency measure based on \cite{latora_efficient_2001} that
quantifies how the network efficiency in transmitting information deteriorates once a node is removed from
the network.
This is described in the results section
\ref{results}. The paper concludes with a discussion section \ref{discussion}
in which it is sketched a new theoretical framework to investigate network robustness and how it is
affected by internal perturbations such as aging and neurological disorders. 



%Next, we study the stochastic process defined by a
%random walk on the functional connectivity graph, in order to use the entropy
%rate of the stationary Markov chain, defined by the transformation of the
%binary adjacency matrix $A$ into a probability transition matrix $T$, $T_{ij}=
%\frac {A_{ij}} {\sum_{j} {A_{ij}}}$. We find that the entropy rate of the
%functional connectivity network modeled as a Markov chain explains why the
%removal of some nodes increases the efficiency of the informational flow shown
%in the graph based approach.

%The
%Kullback-Leibler distance is here proposed as a measure of the network
%vulnerability relative to the suppression of certain nodes. It is shown that
%the nodes with higher Kullback-Leibler distance relative to the pre insult
%network represent critical elements to be targetted by the neural disease.

\section{Materials and Methods}
\label{mat-methods}
%Materials Experimental (Li)
\subsection{Subjects}
Twenty-three healthy male volunteers (ages 21-32; mean 22.7) took part in the
fMRI experiment. All subjects had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. The
study was approved by the ethics committee of Okayama University, and written
informed consent was obtained before the study. 
\subsection{Data acquisition}
 All subjects were imaged using a 1.5 T Philips scanner vision whole-body MRI
 system (Okayama University Hospital, Okayama, Japan), which was equipped with
 a head coil. Functional MR images were acquired during rest when subjects were
 instructed to keep their eyes closed and not to think of anything in
 particular. The imaging area consisted of 32 functional gradient-echo planar
 imaging (EPI) axial slices (voxel size=3x3x4 mm3, TR=3000 ms, TE=50 ms,
 FA=90º, 64x64 matrix) that were used to obtain T2*-weighted fMRI images in the
 axial plane. We obtained 176 functional volumes and excluded the first 4 scans
 from analysis. Before the EPI scan, a T1-weighted 3D magnetization-prepared
 rapid acquisition gradient echo (MP-RAGE) sequence was acquired (TR=2300 ms,
 TE=2.98 ms, TI=900 ms, voxel size=1x1x1 mm3).

\subsection{Data preprocessing} 
Data were preprocessed using Statistical Parametric Mapping software SPM8
\footnote{http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/} and REST v1.7
\footnote{http://restfmri.net/forum/index.php}. To correct for differences in
slice acquisition time, all images were synchronized to the middle slice.
Subsequently, images were spatially realigned to the first volume due to head
motion. None of the subjects had head movements exceeding 2.5 mm on any axis or
rotations greater than 2.5º. After the correction,  the imaging data were
normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) EPI template supplied
with SPM8 (resampled to 2x2x2 mm3 voxels) \footnote{http://imaging.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/imaging/Templates}. In order to avoid
artificially introducing local spatial correlation, the normalized images were
not smoothed. Finally, the resulting data were temporally band-pass filtered
(0.01-0.08 Hz) to reduce the effects of low-frequency drifts and high-frequency
physiological noises \cite{jiao_granger_2011}.

\subsection{Anatomical parcellation} 
Before whole brain parcellation, several sources of spurious variance including
the estimated head motion parameters, the global brain signal and the average
time series in the cerebrospinal fluid and white matter regions were removed
from the data through linear regression \cite{REF}. Then, the fMRI data
were parcellated into 90 regions using an automated anatomical labeling template \cite{REF}.
For each subject, the mean time series of each region was obtained by simply
averaging the time series of all voxels within that region.

\subsection{Brain network construction} 
To measure the functional connectivity among regions, we calculated the Pearson
correlation coefficients between any possible pair of regional time series, and
then obtained a temporal correlation matrix $(90x90)$ for each subject. We
applied Fisher's r-to-z transformation to improve the normality of the
correlation matrix. Then, two-tailed one-sample t-tests were performed for all
the possible 4005 i.e., $\frac{90x89}{2}$ pairwise correlations across subjects
to examine whether each inter-regional correlation significantly differed from
zero. 

\begin{figure}[!h]

among regions based on the temporal correlation matrix of the twenty-three
healthy controls, using Pajek software \cite{batagelj_pajek_2004}}
\label{Fig:Pajek}
\end{center}
\end{figure} 

A Bonferroni-corrected significance level of $P<0.001$ was
further used to threshold the correlation matrix into an adjacency matrix whose
element was 1 if there was significant correlation between the two brain
regions and 0 otherwise. Finally, an undirected binary graph was acquired in
which nodes represent brain regions and edges represent links between regions.
The study of the connectivity distribution of the resulting adjacency matrix is
provided in the Appendix \ref{appendix}.

\subsection{Graph theoretic analysis}
Until the recent advent of graph theoretic methods in R-fMRI, the focus was
put on the identification of anatomically separated regions that show a
high level of functional correlation during rest. 
The tools we use to model a system may also convey an ontological
version of it, that is to say, the system under study is seen through the
lens of a specific approach that necessarily shapes the observability domain. 
Thus, the identification of different subnetworks during rest can be seen as a
 by-product of the techniques used, for example identification component
 analysis (ICA) or clustering. 
Graph theory provides a
theoretical framework to investigate the overall architecture of the brain.
The use of graph theoretic techniques to  model brain networks has shifted the 
emphasis from the identification of local subnetworks -default mode network,
primary sensory motor network etc.- to the quantitative study of the topological
and informational characteristics of large-scale brain networks.
Graph theory-based approaches model the brain as
 a complex network in which nodes represent brain regions of interest and the
 edges connecting nodes represent relationship between nodes e.g., functional
 connectivity. 
 
 The graph-based network provides a geometric representation to
 visualize brain connectivity patterns and an analytic toolbox to
 quantitatively characterize the overall topological organization.   
 %adv
Graph-based techniques have proliferated in the last years providing new
insights into the structure function relationship in the healthy brain, and
in aging and neuropathological disorders \cite{fair_functional_2009}, 
\cite{wang_graph-based_2010}, \cite{he_graph_2010}. Prove of the utility of this
approach is that notable proponents of a modularist vision of brain
connectivity to understand cognition, such as Gazzaniga
\cite{gazzaniga_new_1999} (see \cite{Fuster:2000} for an early critic of the
modularist approach and anticipating a shift toward a networks) has now
embraced the complex brain networks approach to understand the interplay
between structure and function in brain systems \cite{bassett_understanding_2011}.

\subsubsection{Network robustness, efficiency and node vulnerability}
\label{ss:nrobeffvul}
%Distance related measures (Network Efficiency and Network Vulnerability)
A critical aspect is to understand network robustness, that is, functional
network invariance under perturbation. In essence, robustness measures the
capacity of the network to perform the same function before and after a
perturbation. Perturbations are events, internal or external, that elicit a
change in the network configuration, as for example in, to obliterate a node or
a change in the connectivity between nodes. 
Thus, for a given network  $G(N,E)$ with an adjacency matrix $A$, a perturbation
$\delta$ (e.g., the removal of a set of nodes $M$ from $N$) transforms $A$ into
a new adjacency matrix $A'$. Thus, the initial graph $G(N,E)$ is transformed
into a new post perturbation graph $G(N-M,E-E(M))$, where $E-E(M)$ is the set
of edges that do not connect any of the deleted nodes in $M$. 
Now we want to calculate the robustness of the network to the perturbations.
Robustness is here studied as a loss in the efficiency. Thus, the robustness
measure, $\mathcal{R}$ for a network $G$ is defined as the relative performance
retained or efficiency loss under a network insult i.e., a perturbation $\delta$, 
that transforms the initial network $G$ into $G^{\delta}$.
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{R^{\delta}(G)}= \frac {\Sigma(G^{\delta)}} {\Sigma(G)}
\label{eq:rob}
\end{equation}
Thus, from equation \ref{eq:rob}, a network $G$ is considered to be robust if
the network performance or efficiency $\Sigma(G)$ stays close to the original value after a
 perturbation, ideally $\mathcal{R^{\delta}}=1$. 
 %The dual of
 %robustness in vulnerability. Therefore, Vulnerability $\mathcal{V}$ is here
 %used as the complementary of robustness, therefore $\mathcal{V^{\delta}}+
 %\mathcal{R^{\delta}}=1$
 
Now, we need to provide the formal definition of network efficiency. The
efficiency of a network $G$ ,$\Sigma(G)$, is a network centrality
measure that quantifies how likely the network is robust to the deletion of
nodes i.e., the network's reliability in transmitting information, once a
node or a set of nodes are removed. The network efficiency can be 
calculated using the Latora and Marchiori measure
\cite{latora_efficient_2001}. Acordingly, the efficiency of the graph $G(N,E)$,
$\Sigma(G(N,E))$, is
\begin{equation}
\Sigma(G)=\frac{1}{n(n-1) \sum_{i \neq j \in N} \frac{1}{d_{ij}} }
\label{eq:latm}
\end{equation}
where $n$ is the number of nodes or $|N|$ and $d_{ij}$ is the
shortest path length (the geodesic distance) between nodes $i$ and $j$. Note
that $0 \leq d_{ij}= d_{ji} \leq 1 $.
According to equation \ref{eq:latm}, a network $G$ with an average distance
between any pair of nodes $\Sigma(G)=l$ is more efficient than 
a network $H$ with an average distance between any pair of nodes $\Sigma(G)=m$,
if and only if $l > m$.
The global network efficiency is 0.3678 for young subjects and 0.1144 for elder
subjects. Thus, young subjects connecivity network is three times more
efficient in terms of the shortest path distance between any two nodes.
%Use ``graphshortestpath'' to calculate shortest path problem in 
%from http://www.mathworks.es/es/help/bioinfo/network-analysis-and-visualization.html

%We want to
%measure the network vulnerability, to do so we calculate the geodesic path
%sdistance between any two nodes in the graph.
 
  

%Efficiency is a global property of the graph -centrality measure- see paper 
% Bremen. Related to local measure, vul(n) tells how important, in terms of
% grpah eff. is  the deletion of node n or ?nodes?


We can, in addition to robustness and efficiency which are global measures,
study the vulnerability of each node. The vulnerability of a node $i$, $vul(i)$
represents how the deletion of node $i$ affects the efficiency and the
robustness of the resulting network. 
\begin{equation}
vul(i)=\frac {\Sigma(G(N,E)) - \Sigma(G(N-i,E)) } {\Sigma(G(N,E))} 
\label{eq:vul}
\end{equation}

In Table \ref{Table:BA} (see Excel file) is shown the vulnerability value for
each of the AAL regions. %and their associated Broadmann area. 
Interestingly, there are some nodes
that when removed, the overall network vulnerability decreased -nodes 89 to 41
for young subjects and nodes 33 to 88 in the table for Elder subjects.
In young subjects, the deletion of node 89 results in an increase
in the overall network efficiency of a 22.7\% according to the formula
\ref{eq:vul}. The network vulnerability deteriorates for the the remaining 63 nodes.
The worst performance occurred when nodes 60, 31, 50,  46,
73 and 30 are deleted in which case vulnerability of the overall resulting
network is increased between 20\% and 10\%. In elder subjects, the removal of
nodes 34, 24, 8 and 62 shows a loss in efficiency between 24.9\% (node 34)  and
31.3\% (node 62).

LI: What can we find in the litterature to explain or contextualize this
results?

LI: Do you think is a good idea to remove entire networks , e.g., DMN (AAL 23,
24, 25, 26) rather than single nodes as I did ?

 LI: It would be nice to have MCI and AD data too. Can you provide me that? With
this anlysis we maybe could be able to classify between Young, Elder, MCI and AD
based on the network vulnerability.

\subsection{Information theoretic analysis on Markov chains}
The undirected binary graph depicted in Figure \ref{Fig:Pajek} is the geometric
characterisation of the adjacency matrix $A$, in which $a_{ij}=1$ if AAL region
$i$ and AAL region $j$ show a significant correlation, and $a_{ij}=0$ otherwise.
We transform the binary adjacency matrix $A$ into a weighted adjacency matrix
$T$, where $T_{ij}=\frac {a_{ij}} {\sum_{j} {a_{ij}}}$. The new graph has the
same number of nodes each with a weight  $T_{ij} \geq 0 $ on the link that
connects node i and node j.  $T_{ij} = 0$ if nodes are
not connected and symmetry  $T_{ij}= T_{ji}$ is also preserved.

Now, let us consider a random walk -a particle moves from node to node- on the
weighted undirected graph $T$. Thus, a random walk ${X_n} X_n \in
\{1,2,\ldots n\}$ is a list of nodes visited by the particle. The probability
that the particle moves from i to j is given by  $T_{ij}$. 
This stochastic process defines a Markov chain because the probability that
that the particle moves from state $n$ to state $n+1$ is independent of the
previous states, that is, $P(X_{n+1}=x_{n+1}|X_{n}=x_{n})=
P(X_{n+1}=x_{n+1}|X_{n}=x_{n},X_{n-1}=x_{n-1}, \ldots ,X_{1}=x_{1} ) \forall
x_1, \ldots, x_n  \in \mathcal{X}$.
%%Check WSD toolbox
The stationary distribution of the random walk on the undirected graph is 
$\mu=\frac {k_i} {2E}$, where $k_i$ is the connectivity degree of node i and E
is the total number of links contained in the graph. Thus, the stationary
distribution is given by the N (the number of nodes) dimensional vector
$\mu=\{\frac {k_1} {2E}, \frac {k_2} {2E}, \ldots , \frac {k_N} {2E}$. It ought to be noted that the
stationary distribution does not depend on the number of nodes, but only on the total
number of links E, and the weight of the neighbor nodes. Thus, the stationary
distribution holds the local property that it is not altered by changes
in the weights of non neighbors nodes, while keeping the total weight
of the graph constant.
 
The entropy rate of a stochastic process represents the rate at
which the entropy of a sequence e.g., a random walk, grows with n. Formally, for
the stochastic process $\mathcal{X}=\{X_1, \ldots , X_i, \ldots , X_n\}$ the
entropy rate is given by
\begin{equation}
H(\mathcal{X})= \lim_{n \to \inf}\frac{1}{n} H(X_1,X_2, \ldots , X_n)
\end{equation}
For a stationary Markov chain, the entropy rate is  
\begin{equation}
H(\mathcal{X})= \lim_{n \to \inf} H(X_n | X_{n-1}, \ldots , X_1)=  \lim_{n \to
\inf} H(X_n  | X_{n-1}) =  \lim_{n \to
\inf} H(X_2  | X_{1})
\end{equation}
The entropy rate is computed with the stationary distribution of the Markov
chain $\mu$ and the transition matrix $T$. Then
\begin{equation}
H(\mathcal{X})= - \sum_{ij} \mu_i T_{ij}\log  T_{ij} 
\end{equation}

We define a Markov process for both the young subjects and the elder ones
with their transition matrix given by $T_{ij}^{y}$ and $T_{ij}^{e}$ respectively
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{l}
\displaystyle  T_{ij}^{y}=\frac {A_{ij}^{y}} {\sum_{j} {A_{ij}^{y}}} ,
\displaystyle T_{ij}^{e}=\frac {A_{ij}^{e}} {\sum_{j} {A_{ij}^{e}}} 
\end{array}
\end{equation}
where $A_{ij}^{y}$ and  $A_{ij}^{e}$ are the binary adjacency matrix of the young and the elder subjects.
Thus, the entropy rate is
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{l}
\displaystyle H(\mathcal{X}^{y}) = - \sum_{ij} \mu^{y}_{i}  T_{ij}^{y} \log 
T_{ij}^{y} \\
 \displaystyle  H(\mathcal{X}^{e}) = - \sum_{ij} \mu^{e}_{i}  T_{ij}^{e} \log 
T_{ij}^{e}
\end{array}
\label{eq:enrate}
 \end{equation}
where 
$T_{ij}^{y}=\frac {A_{ij}^{y}} {\sum_{j} {A_{ij}^{y}}}$  and  $T_{ij}^{e}=\frac
{A_{ij}^{e}} {\sum_{j} {A_{ij}^{e}}}$ 

We calculate the entropy rate for the resulting Markov process after
having delete a node or a group of nodes in both
young and elder subjects. 
%the same as in the previous sections to compare the results
Thus, the relative entropy of the stochastic process defined by the set of
states $\mathcal{X'}= \mathcal{X} - X_k $
in which the set of nodes $X_k$ and their respective edges has been removed
from the initial chain $\mathcal{X}$ is

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{l}
\displaystyle H(\mathcal{X'}) = - \sum_{ij, i,j  \not \subset k } \mu_{i} 
T_{ij} \log T_{ij}
\end{array}
\label{eq:tijenrate}
 \end{equation}

Now we compare the entropy rate after
deletion of each node in both young an elder subjkects and the vulnerability
after node removal as calculated in Section \ref{ss:nrobeffvul}.

%!* Biased vs unbiased 
%To calculate the entropy rate we follow \cite{gomez-gardenes_entropy_2008} in
%which the Markv process is a biased random walk with a probability for the
%walker to move from node i to node j proportional to the power$\alpha$ of the
%destination node degree $k_j$ . The transition
%probability matrix os this kinfd of biased random walk is given by the
%expression:
%\begin{equation}
%\begin{array}{l}
%\displaystyle T_{ij} = \frac {A_{ij}k_{j}^\alpha} {\sum_{j}A_{ij}k_{j}^\alpha}
%\end{array}
%\label{enrategeneral}
 %\end{equation}
%Note that the parameter $\alpha$ allows to tune the bias. Thus, when $\alpha
%>0$ the walker tends to visit neighbors with high degree and when $\alpha <0$
%the walker tends to visit more ofter neighbors that are poorly connected.
%Here, for simplicity, we assume that the random walk is unbiased, so $\alpha =
%0$ and the transitivity matrix is
%\begin{equation}
%\begin{array}{l}
%\displaystyle T_{ij} = \frac {A_{ij}} {\sum_{j}A_{ij}}
%\end{array}

\section{Results}
\label{results}

We have analyzed the functional connectivity in resting state of both young and
elder individuals. The nodes representing the ninety brain regions based on the
AAL parcelation have been ranked in terms of their impact in terms of network
robustness upon removal. Interestingly we find that in both elder and young
groups the removal of certain nodes does not necessarily triggers a
decrease in network robustness, the obliteration of certain nodes may also 
produces a positive impact in the network function, increasing the  network
robustness  when the node is removed.
We study network robustness based on the new network efficiency/performance
 measure (equation \ref{eq:latm}) to investigate the network
 functionality when a set of nodes are obliterated. 
The results show that in young subjects, the nodes with a positive impact
are \ldots TO DO LI/JAIME compared with elder subjects \ldots TO DO LI/JAIME.

In the second part we use information-theoretic measures to study the impact of
the removal of nodes in the network. First, we model the network flows in terms
of a stationary Markov chain which describes how a particle walks randomly from
node to node, in both the young and elder functional connectivity graph. The
probability transition matrix is derived from the binary adjacency matrix using
the local property of connectivity degree.
The entropy rate of a
random walk on a graph in which a node or group of nodes has been removed is
calculated.

The results show that in young subjects, after he removal of the nodes with
a positive impact the entropy rate is $> <?$ TO DO JAIME than in the case of
elder subjects.
