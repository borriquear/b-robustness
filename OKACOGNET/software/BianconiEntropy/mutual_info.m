function[result]=mutual_info(P1,P2,Pb,b)
%Calculate the mutual information by using the formula
%I(X;Y)=H(X)+H(Y)-H(X,Y)
%
% 'P1' is a vector of values for a probability distribution
% 'P2' is an other vector of values for a probability distribution
% 'Pb' is a matrix of the bivariate probability distribution of Pa abd Pb
% 'b' is the base of the logarithm
