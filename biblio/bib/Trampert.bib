	abstract = {Global seismic tomography has produced a great amount of robust 
information concerning the three-dimensional extent of the Earth's 
internal structure. This has stimulated a multidisciplinary discussion 
aimed at understanding the mechanisms which govern the internal 
evolution of our planet. A brief overview of seismic tomography is 
presented. Since geodynamical understanding is the main purpose of 
seismic tomography, some suggestions are made on how to evolve from a 
predominantly qualitative to a more quantitative interpretation of its 
results. We argue that without a more systematic and realistic error and 
resolution analysis, interpretations might be misleading. Assuming a 
steady increase of data quality and coverage, the most challenging 
aspect of seismic tomography will be to take the nonlinearity of the 
problem fully into account. It is hoped that this contribution 
stimulates some discussion in that direction.},
