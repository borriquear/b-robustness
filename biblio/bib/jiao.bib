	abstract = {Although the brain areas in the default-mode network (DMN) act in a coordinated way during rest, the activity levels in the individual areas of the DMN are highly heterogeneous. The relation between the activity levels and the pattern of causal interaction among the DMN areas remains unknown. In the present fMRI study, seven nodes of the DMN were identified and their activity levels were rank-ordered based on a power spectral analysis of the resting blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals. Furthermore, the direction of information flow among these DMN nodes was determined using Granger causality analysis and graph-theoretic methods. We found that the activity levels in these seven DMN nodes had a highly consistent hierarchical distribution, with the highest activity level in the posterior cingulate/precuneus cortices, followed by ventral medial prefrontal cortex and dorsal medial prefrontal cortex, and with the lowest level in the left inferior temporal gyrus. Importantly, a significant correlation was found between the activity levels and the In-Out degrees of information flow across the DMN nodes, suggesting that Granger causal influences can be used to predict BOLD activity levels. These findings shed light on the dynamical organization of cortical neuronal networks and may provide the basis for characterizing network disruption by brain disorders.},
