	abstract = {Lesions of anatomical brain networks result in functional disturbances of brain
                    systems and behavior which depend sensitively, often unpredictably, on the
                    lesion site. The availability of whole-brain maps of structural connections
                    within the human cerebrum and our increased understanding of the physiology and
                    large-scale dynamics of cortical networks allow us to investigate the functional
                    consequences of focal brain lesions in a computational model. We simulate the
                    dynamic effects of lesions placed in different regions of the cerebral cortex by
                    recording changes in the pattern of endogenous
                    (“resting-state”) neural activity. We find that lesions
                    produce specific patterns of altered functional connectivity among distant
                    regions of cortex, often affecting both cortical hemispheres. The magnitude of
                    these dynamic effects depends on the lesion location and is partly predicted by
                    structural network properties of the lesion site. In the model, lesions along
                    the cortical midline and in the vicinity of the temporo-parietal junction result
                    in large and widely distributed changes in functional connectivity, while
                    lesions of primary sensory or motor regions remain more localized. The model
                    suggests that dynamic lesion effects can be predicted on the basis of specific
                    network measures of structural brain networks and that these effects may be
                    related to known behavioral and cognitive consequences of brain lesions., Every year, millions of people suffer the consequences of brain damage, as a
                    result of stroke, traumatic brain injury, cancer or degenerative brain disease.
                    The cognitive and behavioral symptoms of focal lesions of the brain are highly
                    variable and in many cases depend on the location of the lesion site. Can we
                    predict the functional impact of such lesions on the basis of a computational
                    model of the brain's structure and dynamics? Numerous other systems
                    that form complex networks have been analyzed for their vulnerability to
                    structural damage. In many cases, the degree to which such systems are perturbed
                    depends on network attributes of the deleted nodes and connections. We apply
                    this network approach to investigate the structural and functional impact of
                    localized lesions of a model of the cerebral cortex. When we delete nodes that
                    occupy, in the intact brain, a highly central position, we find that the dynamic
                    interactions between nodes in the remaining brain are greatly disturbed. In
                    contrast, deletion of less central nodes has relatively little effect. In the
                    model, some of the most disruptive lesion sites correspond to locations in the
                    brain where lesions produce complex cognitive disturbances. Our modeling
                    approach aims towards linking disturbances of structural brain networks to
                    specific clinical outcomes.},
